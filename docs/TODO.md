## MVP:

- basic auth
    - email
    - username
    - password
    - handle OAuth (is_first_login)
- userstory:
    - user register
    - user request to join a group
    - admin should approve user request
- start just one group for the MVP
- add roadmap (how to track each group idx from the raodmap)
    - each group has idx in the roadmap to track progress
    - add problems dynamically from the roadmap
- allow users to check for progress
- section for sharing solutions
    - add a button to share solutions
    - the button only shows up after checking for progress

## Technical:

- consider supbase requests (cz the free tier is limited)
- isolate API requests to `services` dir (consider feature db migration)
- github action build
- try [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) if applicable
