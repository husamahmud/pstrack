i need to build a platform for tracking problem-solving progress, i have a roadmap that's for daily problem what i wanna do is
create a schema for the following table

date | problem | progress (how many users solved today's problem) | difficulty | user1 (username) | user2 | ...users
4 jan | 125 | 1 | Easy | check | not checked | ...

roadmap table will store problem number & link & difficulty & topic and it's index

we will have more than one group, and we need to track the progress of each user in each group in the raod map
like the group 1 in the 7th problem in the roadmap
the group 2 in the 1st problem in the roadmap

every day we will have a new problem for each group
we starting with a empty problems for a table for each group
